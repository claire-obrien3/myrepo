## Research Interests

Climate change and disturbance impacts on plant functional traits, species composition, and ecosystem function. Ecology and organism plasticity in response to changing environmental conditions.

## Publications

```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
